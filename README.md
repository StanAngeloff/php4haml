========
Port of [phpHaml](http://phphaml.sourceforge.net/) to PHP 4

What is Haml? (taken from website above)
-------------

This is the best Haml definition:

> Haml takes your gross, ugly templates and replaces them with veritable Haiku.
>
> Haml is the next step in generating views in your Rails (also in PHP) application. Haml is a refreshing take that is meant to free us from the shitty templating languages we have gotten used to.
>
> Haml is based on one primary principal. Markup should be beautiful.

I'm not Haml author, I only implemented Haml in PHP. Why? I tested a lot of templating system like Smarty, PHP TAL, clean PHP, but all has one problem - too many unreadable code.
